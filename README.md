### Thank you for looking at my github!
* My name is Corben McClintock and I'm from Kansas City, Missouri. 
* I'm currently working with Turner Construction as a remote IT Intern before I graduate in April 2024.
* I've been focusing on my python skills recently because I have become interested in the data science field. After taking classes such as Big Data, Machine Learning, and Web Mining, I knew that this was a field that I could get into.
